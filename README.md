# chatbot-demo
This repository contains a simple interactive chatbot built using the OpenAI API and Python. The chatbot simulates a conversational assistant that can respond to user queries based on the prompts provided. It is designed as a basic demonstration of how to integrate the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model into a Python application.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- An OpenAI API key

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramyakalyan/chatbot-demo.git
   cd chatbot-demo

2. **Set the OpenAI API Key as an environment variable**:
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```
   - On Mac/Linux:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```
## Usage
1. **Run the chatbot script**:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```
2. **Interact with the chatbot**:
   - Type your questions or prompts and get responses.
   - Type `exit` or `quit` to end the conversation.
  
## Example Output

You: Hello, how are you?
Assistant: I'm a chatbot, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help you!

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: The API key is not set.** Make sure the `OPENAPI_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly.
- **Installation issues:** Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed.
